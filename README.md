The best way to treat a runny nose and sore throat is to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and use over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to reduce pain and fever. A saline nasal spray or drops can help to reduce congestion. A humidifier can also help to soothe a sore throat. If symptoms persist, it is best to consult a doctor."
